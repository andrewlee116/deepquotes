Legend has it that he made all 365 quotes by himself.

How did you make it?
Tensorflow.js was used to convert your ramblings into a label that tells us which quote we should present to you!

Note: Quote_generator.java is simply a program I used to better facilitate the process of putting "labels" to each of my 365 quotes.

The pre-trained model along with example code was provided by Tensorflow in their tensorflow.js examples repository: https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/sentiment
